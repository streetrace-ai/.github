# Welcome to Streetrace
# An Open-Core Enterprise-Ready platform to deploy autonomous AI agents in production

Streetrace enables your engineering teams build and run long-living autonomous agents that drive real metrics, follow your org policies, and don't leak data:

- Create and deploy agents on your infra or in the cloud.
- Apply org-level guardrails to data and behavior.
- Measure outcomes.
- Spot drift before it turns into failure.

Plus the open-source agent runner that can be deployed on your own infrastructure, keeping execution transparent and portable.
