# Early Build-With-Us Partnership

We are selecting **3 Enterprise Design Partners** to shape our V1 Production Release.

A 4-6 week hands-on design partnership. This is a short, focused collaboration, not a sales pitch, not a full deployment, and not a long-term commitment.

We work directly with your team on real back office AI workflows to see where AI actually helps, where guardrails are needed, and which ideas are worth investing into.

The outcome is clarity: what works, what doesn’t, what data is involved, and what’s worth investing in next.

### What you get

- Clear visibility into **where AI is already used** in your workflows
- A new or enhanced controlled, **measurable AI workflow** you can keep
- Early signals for **drift, failure, and data exposure**
- A concrete **recommendation on what to scale**, fix, or stop
- **No obligation** to continue. No pressure to buy.

### Who this is for

- Small to mid-sized companies with active engineering teams
- Not operating in heavily regulated industries
- Care about quality, security, and ownership
- Open to early-stage collaboration

### Process

- Scope definition
- Targeted discovery with engineers and stakeholders
- Controlled experimentation on one or two workflows
- Findings and decision summary

### Commitment

- Several working sessions with engineering
- No production rollout or data access required
- Light async collaboration
- Remote-friendly
- If another tool is a better fit than ours, we will say so.

### Cost and commitment

We don't charge a service fee but we introduce a committment fee ($10,000) fully refundable if you decide not to continue, or credited toward a future paid pilot.

No obligation to continue; No automatic conversion to a paid contract; No long-term lock-in.

This is a collaboration, not a sale.
